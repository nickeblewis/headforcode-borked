title: We research and we develop

# Lets begin...
We are currently working on a range of on-line learning modules that aim to keep you, the busy web developer, up-to-date with the new technologies of our industry. It can be hard work keeping up with it all at the best of times. So we are designing the application within this website with as much care as we can. It should help you not just learn what you are looking to learn but to help you "queue up" future lessons. So consider it a teacher who gets to know you and whom can suggest what you perhaps should learn next.

We also aim to provide a means of helping you identify frameworks and libraries that are on the change. How many times have you gone back to take a project further, only to realise that it's dependencies have changed? You are currently using v0.12.1 when there is actually now a v6.5.21!!!

These things catch us out all of the time. We spend our time learning as many of the new tricks as we possibly can. We are busy too but we are focussed on helping you!

# Coding can be complex! 
One of the reasons I founded H4C was to spend time and a significant amount of it too gaining an understanding of how modern day 
development philosophies work and quite literally write about it in order to become a thought leader in the industry. Through learning 
we improve our skills and we want to share this with others.

By developing a range of courses that you can follow online, some short, ideal for fitting into your working day and others you may 
need to spread across longer periods of times.

The general idea behind immutable data is that it can't be changed once created and 
we shall explore it in more depth both in isolation and together with other libs.
