## What is FRP?
The simple answer to this question is that there is no simple answer. To the more academic side of the industry, FRP is all about values that change over time, sometimes called signals. But to the rest of the industry, FRP is more of an umbrella term that refers less to this esoteric definition, and more to the ancillary constructs and ideas that are generally part of FRP. These ideas and technologies include:

* Immutable data
* Observables
* Pure functions
* Static typing
* One-way state transitions

Letâ€™s take a quick look at each one of these items.
